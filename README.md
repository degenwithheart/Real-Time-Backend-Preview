> **A hosted backend service that provides live, real-time API responses for frontend developers**

Real-Time Backend Preview simulates how a real backend will behave — including real-time updates via WebSockets — so you can build, test, and demo frontend features before the actual backend is ready.

It acts as a temporary stand-in for your production backend, allowing you to preview frontend components that depend on dynamic data or live updates.
